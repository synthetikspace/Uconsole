These are my personal Clockwork Pi Uconsole config files and misc files.
Desktop items include;
  • Fullscreen KIOSK mode Chromium Browser with specific urls.
  • Desktop menu items that launch;
                                  • Newsboat
                                  • Pyradio

I'll also be adding my Links2 graphical mode theme colors.

These files might be helpfull for some people.
